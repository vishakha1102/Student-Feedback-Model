# Student-Feedback-Model

## Situation
I wanted to create a model that helps predict student feedback based on various parameters. To achieve this, I used a student evaluation dataset and tested different machine learning algorithms.

## Task
My goal was to apply machine learning algorithms like Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and others to the student evaluation dataset. I aimed to assess the model's performance by evaluating different parameters like accuracy, precision, true positive rate, and more. My primary programming language for this project was Python.

## Action
Here's how I carried out the project:

- **Dataset**: I obtained a dataset that contained information about student evaluations, including factors like class size, instructor's rating, and more.

- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: I implemented various machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree, SVM, and KNN, to build predictive models based on the dataset.

- **Data Preprocessing**: I performed data preprocessing tasks, such as cleaning the data and handling missing values, to ensure the dataset was suitable for model training.

- **Model Evaluation**: I tested the models using different parameters to assess their performance. This involved measuring accuracy, precision (the ability of the model to correctly classify positive instances), true positive rate (the ratio of true positives to all actual positives), and other relevant metrics.

- **Python Programming**: Python was my primary programming language for this project. I used Python's libraries for data analysis (e.g., Pandas), machine learning (e.g., Scikit-Learn), and data visualization (e.g., Matplotlib) to implement and evaluate the models.

## Result
The project resulted in a predictive model that could forecast student feedback based on the dataset. By applying various machine learning algorithms, I was able to assess the model's accuracy, precision, true positive rate, and other critical parameters.

## Key Benefits
- **Educational Tool**: This project serves as an educational tool for understanding how machine learning can be applied to predict student feedback.

- **Insights for Educators**: The model can offer insights to educators and institutions by helping them understand the factors that influence student feedback.

- **Data-Driven Decision-Making**: The model enables data-driven decision-making for educational institutions to improve the overall learning experience.
